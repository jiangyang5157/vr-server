Originally inhabited by the Wabanakipeople, the area includes mountains, an ocean shoreline, woodlands, and lakes.In addition to Mount Desert Island, the park comprises much of the Isle auHaut, a small island to the southwest of Mount Desert Island and parts of BakerIsland, also nearby. A portion of Schoodic Peninsula on the mainland is alsopart of the park. In total, Acadia National Park consists of 30,300 acres (47square miles or 123 km2) on Mount Desert Island, 2,728 acres (4.6 square milesor 11 km2) on Isle au Haut and 2,366 acres (3.5 square miles or 9.2 km2) on theSchoodic Peninsula.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thelandscape architect Charles Elliot is credited with the idea for the park. Itfirst attained federal status when President Woodrow Wilson, established it asSieur de Monts National Monument on July 8, 1916, administered by the NationalPark Service. On February 26, 1919, it became a national park, with the nameLafayette National Park in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette, an influentialFrench supporter of the American Revolution. The park's name was changed toAcadia National Park on January 19, 1929. From 1915 to 1933, the wealthy philanthropistJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr. financed, designed, and directed the construction of anetwork of carriage trails throughout the park. The network encompassed over 50miles (80 km) of gravel carriage trails, 17 granite bridges, and two gatelodges, almost all of which are still maintained and in use today. Cut granitestones placed along the edges of the carriage roads act as guard rails of sortand are locally known as "coping stones" to help visitors cope withthe steep edges. They are also fondly called "Rockefeller's teeth".

The main feature of the Monument is a valley of the Niobrara River, and the fossils found on Carnegie Hill and University Hill. The area largely consists of grass-covered plains. Plants on the site include prairie sandreed, blue grama, little bluestem and needle and thread grass, and the wildflowers lupin, spiderwort, western wallflower and sunflowers. The site is best known for the large number of well-preserved Miocene fossils, many of which were found at dig sites on Carnegie and University Hills. Fossils from the site, which date from about 20 million years ago, are among some of the best specimens of Miocene mammals. <br><br>Originally the Agate Springs Ranch, a working cattle ranch, was owned by Capt. James Cook. The monument's museum collection also contains more than 500 artifacts from the Cook Collection of Plains Indian artifacts. The national monument was authorized on June 5, 1965, but was not established until June 14, 1997.

It has a catchment area of approximately 1400 square mi (3600 km²). It is located in central Lake and Peninsula Borough. In Yupik, the word "Alagnak" means "to err." Every year, the river changes its course and branches anew, for which reason it is sometimes called the "Branch River."<br><br>Due to the large numbers of salmon, there is a significant bear population in the summer and fall, including both grizzly and black bears. The majority of the catchment area is a winter habitat for Alaskan caribou. Moose are also to be found during the entire year. Along the river, beaver, foxes, wolverines, mink, and otter are all found as well occasional wolf. In the water, there are several varieties of salmon, including sockeye salmon, pink salmon, chum salmon, king salmon, and silver salmon. There are also rainbow trout, char, arctic grayling, and northern pike. Along the river there is also eclectic vegetation including spruces, willows and various types of berries.<br><br>The upper 67 mi (108 km) of the river is designated as a protected "wild and scenic river" in accordance with ANILCA, the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act. This part of the river is known as the Alagnak Wild River. (Source Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alagnak_Wild_River))<br><br>http://www.nps.gov/alag]]></description>

It offers visitors a glimpse of both natural and cultural history, and traces the historic footprints of the U.S. Army Base, Fort Schwatka, located at the Ulakta Head on Mount Ballyhoo. The fort, 800 miles west of Anchorage, the nearest large urban center, was one of four coastal defense posts built to protect Dutch Harbor (crucial back door to the United States) during World War II; Fort Schwatka is also the highest coastal battery ever constructed in the United States. Engineers designed the concrete observation posts and command stations to withstand earthquakes and 100 mph winds. Although today, many of the bunkers and wooden structures of Fort Schwatka have collapsed, the gun mounts and lookouts are among the most intact in the country.<br><br>In 1996, the United State Congress designated this a National Historic Area as a way of educating future generations both about the history of the Aleut people, and the role the Aleutian Islands played in the defense of the United States in World War II.

It was a series of 10 inclines, approximately 36 miles (58 km) long, and operated from 1834 to 1854. It connected two canal divisions of the Main Line of Public Works of the Pennsylvania Canal from Johnstown on the west to Hollidaysburg on the east, thus allowing continuous barge traffic between the Ohio and the Susquehanna rivers. Considered a technological marvel in its day, it played a critical role in opening the interior of the United States beyond the Appalachian Mountains to settlement and commerce. It included the first railroad tunnel in the United States, the Staple Bend Tunnel, and its inauguration was marked with great fanfare.<br><br>Today, the remains of the railroad are preserved within the Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site operated by the National Park Service. The site was established on 1,296 acres (524 ha) in 1964 and is about 12 miles (19.3 km) west of Altoona,[citation needed] in Blair and Cambria counties.

"Amistad" is Spanish for "friendship", as the Amistad Reservoir is located on the border with Mexico. The reservoir was created by Amistad Dam in 1969.<br><br>The lake provides year-round, water-based recreation opportunities, including boating, fishing, swimming, scuba diving and water-skiing, as well as other recreational opportunities for picnicking, camping and hunting. The area is rich in archeology and rock art, and contains a wide variety of plant and animal life. For highly experienced scuba divers, there is a system of deep underwater caves that can be accessed. The dive includes exotic gas mixes, pre-placement of gas cylinders, and extensive decompression times at depth. These caves are considered extremely hazardous and should not be attempted by anyone without extensive training and preparation.<br><br>The site was administered under a cooperative agreement with the International Boundary and Water Commission as Amistad Recreation Area, November 11, 1965. It was authorized as a National Recreation Area on November 28, 1990.

It is known for its collection of historic lighthouses, sandstone sea caves, a few old growth remnant forests, and natural animal habitats.<br><br>The Apostle Islands are a result of the glaciers that once covered North America. “Geologically they are originally part of the main land at the edge of the great riff or fault which formed the depression to which the waters of Lake Superior collected.” When the glaciers melted, waves from the waters of Lake Superior caused erosion that formed the islands. The islands are composed of mostly red sandstone because of the glacial shift.<br><br>It is widely assumed that Indians were the first to inhabit the island. “There is some evidence that they were seen and possibly visited sometime in the fourteenth century by Indians who were making their way to Isle Royale near the north shore of the land in search of copper.” Not long after, the islands were visited by Étienne Brûlé, a French explorer who, like many French Canadians, was trying to discover a new way to the East Indies. "The French are believed to have named the islands 'Apostle' meaning 12, because they believed in the practice of giving names of religious significance to geographic locations." It is said that fur traders were the first explorers to settle in the area, building a village from the money they brought in.<br><br>United States Senator Gaylord Nelson sponsored the federal legislation that established the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Public Law 91-424 was signed by the President on September 26, 1970. It included 20 islands, a 12-mile strip of the mainland, and approximately 1/4 mile of Lake Superior jurisdiction adjacent to each land unit. After the National Park Service completed a wilderness study in 2004, and received overwhelming support from the public, Congress designated 80% of the land area of the national lakeshore as the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness on December 8, 2004.

Lee Memorial, also known asthe Custis-Lee Mansion, is a Greek revival style mansion located inArlington, Virginia, USA and was once the home of Confederate General Robert E.Lee. It overlooks the Potomac River, directly across from the National Mall inWashington, D.C. During the American Civil War, the grounds of the mansion wereselected as the site of Arlington National Cemetery, in part to ensure that Leewould never again be able to return to his home. However, the United States hassince designated the mansion as a National Memorial to its former opponent, amark of widespread respect for him in both the North and South.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The federal government had confiscated the mansion property,in 1864, claiming that property taxes had not been paid. Robert E. Lee and hiswife never legally challenged the return of the home. In 1870, after hisfather's death, George Washington Custis Lee, the eldest son of Robert E. Lee,filed a lawsuit in the Alexandria Circuit Court which resulted in a laterSupreme Court decision in 1882 awarding Custis Lee just compensation for thehouse and 1,100 acres (4 km2). Lee originally asked for $300,000, however, thecourt only awarded $150,000, considered the fair market value of the property.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Congress designated the mansion as a memorial to Lee in 1955, and it wasplaced on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.

TheNational Preserve protects a remnant of the Bering Land Bridge that connectedAsia with North America more than 13,000 years ago during the Pleistocene iceage. The majority of this land bridge, once thousands of miles wide, now liesbeneath the waters of the Chukchi and Bering Seas.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>During the glacial epoch this was part of a migration routefor people, animals, and plants whenever ocean levels fell enough to expose theland bridge. Archeologists agree that it was across this Bering Land Bridge,also called Beringia, that humans first migrated from Asia to populate theAmericas.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The preserve was originally established on December 1, 1978,as Bering Land Bridge National Monument. On December 2, 1980, the designationwas changed to a National Preserve. The Preserve's western boundary lies 42miles from the Bering Strait and the fishing boundary between the United Statesand Russia. There are no roads into the preserve. Access to the preserve is bybush planes or boats during summer months and by ski planes, snowmobiles or dogsleds during the winter.

For more than 1,000 miles (1600 km), the Rio Grande / Río Bravo forms the international boundary between Mexico and the United States, and Big Bend National Park administers approximately 244 miles (393 km) along that boundary.<br><br>Big Bend National Park has national significance as the largest protected area of Chihuahuan Desert topography and ecology in the United States, which includes more than 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds, 56 species of reptiles, and 75 species of mammals. The park covers 801,163 acres (3,242 km2). Few areas exceed the park's value for the protection and study of geologic and paleontologic resources. Cretaceous and Tertiary fossil organisms exist in variety and abundance. Archeologists have discovered artifacts estimated to be 9,000 years old, and historic buildings and landscapes offer graphic illustration of life along the international border in the 1800s.<br><br>Because the Rio Grande serves as an international boundary, the park faces unusual constraints when administering and enforcing park rules, regulations, and policies. In accordance with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the park has jurisdiction only to the center of the deepest river channel as the river flowed in 1848. The rest of the land south of that channel, and the river, lies within Mexican territory.

While no exact boundaries exist, the area occupies much ofHardin County, Liberty, Tyler, San Jacinto, and Polk Counties and is roughlybounded by the San Jacinto River, Neches River, and Pine Island Bayou.

The Big Thicket National Preserve wasestablished in 1974 in an attempt to protect the many plant and animal specieswithin. Big Thicket National Preserve, along with Big Cypress National Preservein Florida, became the first national preserves in the United States NationalPark System when both were authorized by the United States Congress on 11October 1974. Big Thicket was also designated as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCOin 1981.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>A dirt road leading north out of the town of Saratoga is thecore of the area's predominant ghost story. Bragg Road, as it is more formallyknown, was constructed in 1934 on the bed of a former railroad line that hadserviced the lumber industry. In the 1940s, stories began to circulate about a mysteriouslight, sometimes referred to as the Light of Saratoga, that could be seen onand near the road at night. No adequate explanation of the light has beenoffered. The various ghost stories include reference to the Kaiser Burnout,long-dead conquistadors looking for their buried treasure, a decapitated railroadworker, and a lost night hunter eternally searching for a way out. Less paranormal explanations include swamp gas, andautomobile headlights filtering through the trees.

There are two visitor centers and other developed facilities; one inFort Smith, Montana, and one near Lovell, Wyoming. The Afterbay Lake below theYellowtail Dam is a good spot for trout fishing and wildlife viewing for ducks,geese, and other animals. The Bighorn River below the Afterbay Dam is a worldclass trout fishing area. North of Lovell, there is a spot where one can standon the canyon rim, shout, and hear a "triple echo."

The park preserves Biscayne Bay, one of the top scuba diving areas in the United States. Ninety-five percent of the park is water. In addition, the shore of the bay is the location of an extensive mangrove forest. The park covers 207 mi² (700 km²).<br><br>Elliott Key, the park's largest island, is considered the first of the true Florida Keys being formed from fossilized coral reef, i.e. Key Largo limestone. The islands farther north in the park are transitional islands of coral and sand.<br><br>The major attraction of the park is scuba diving or snorkeling on the coral reef inside the bay. It is also possible to take a glass-bottom boat tour of the bay, or rent kayaks to explore the bay and the islands (Florida Keys) in it. While accessing the historic homes of Stiltsville is currently not allowed by casual visitors, these structures may still be observed from boats.

There are two entrances to the park; the more-developed south rim entrance is located 15 miles (24 km) east of Montrose, while the north rim entrance is located 11 miles (18 km) south of Crawford and is closed in the winter. The park contains 12 miles (19 km) of the 48-mile (77 km) long canyon of the Gunnison river. The national park itself contains the deepest and most dramatic section of the canyon, but the canyon continues upstream into the Curecanti National Recreation Area and downstream into the Gunnison Gorge <br><br>The Gunnison River drops an average of 43 feet per mile (8 m/km) through the entire canyon, making it one of the steepest mountain descents in North America. In comparison, the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon drops an average of 7.5 feet per mile (1.4 m/km). The greatest descent of the Gunnison River occurs in the park at Chasm View dropping 240 feet per mile (45 m/km). The Black Canyon is so named on account of its steepness which makes it difficult for sunlight to penetrate very far down the canyon. As a result, the canyon walls are most often in shadow, causing the rocky walls to appear black. At its narrowest point the canyon is only 40 feet (12 m) across at the river.<br><br>The area was established as a U.S. National Monument on March 2, 1933 and made into a National Park on October 21, 1999.

Contained within the park is Bryce Canyon. Despite its name, this is not actually a canyon, but rather a giant natural amphitheater created by erosion along the eastern side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Bryce is distinctive due to its geological structures, called hoodoos, formed from wind, water, and ice erosion of the river and lakebed sedimentary rocks. The red, orange and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views to visitors. Bryce is at a much higher elevation than nearby Zion National Park and the Grand Canyon. The rim at Bryce varies from 8,000 to 9,000 feet (2,400 to 2,700 m), whereas the south rim of the Grand Canyon sits at 7,000 feet (2,100 m) above sea level.<br><br>The Bryce area was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 1850s and was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1874. The area around Bryce Canyon became a U.S. National Monument in 1923 and was designated as a national park in 1928. The park covers 56 square miles (145 km2) and receives relatively few visitors compared to Zion Canyon and the Grand Canyon, largely due to its remote location.

It was first established as a protected area by the U.S. Government in 1948, with the intention of preserving “one of the finest marine gardens in the Caribbean Sea.” The U.S. National Monument was created in 1961 by John F. Kennedy and greatly expanded in 2001 by Bill Clinton, over the bitter opposition of local fishermen. Most of the Monument area, which is administered by the National Park Service, is underwater.<br><br>With its 4,554-acre long reef there is plenty to explore and experience in the water. Snorkelers can follow an underwater marked trail on the eastern tip. It is one of only three underwater trails in the United States. Along the trail are plaques denoting information about marine flora and fauna commonly found in the area.<br><br>There are actually two Buck Islands in the Virgin Islands. The one just north of St. Croix is the centerpiece of the National Monument. Buck Island National Wildlife Refuge occupies the one near St. Thomas.

It commemorates the landing of Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo at San Diego Bay on September 28, 1542. This event marked the first time that a European expedition had set foot on what later became the west coast of the United States. On October 14, 1913, by presidential proclamation, Woodrow Wilson reserved 0.5 acres (2,000 m2) of Fort Rosecrans for "The Order of Panama . . . to construct a heroic statue of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo." By 1926 no statue had been placed and the Order of Panama was defunct, so Calvin Coolidge authorized the Native Sons of the Golden West to erect a suitable monument. The heroic statue of Cabrillo, looking out over the bay, was executed by sculptor Alvaro de Bree for the Portuguese Government in 1939, who then donated it to the United States. The sandstone monument is 14 feet (4.3 m) tall and weighs 14,000 pounds (6,400 kg). The adjacent museum screens a film about Cabrillo's voyage and has exhibits about the expedition. The area of the national monument was enlarged significantly by Presidents Eisenhower and Ford.

Itwas used primarily from 1841 to 1869. It followed the same corridor of trails,following different river valleys, as the Oregon Trail and the Mormon Trailtill it turned off in Idaho, Wyoming or Utah to follow trails leading to theHumboldt River valley. Most of the trail across the Great Basin in Nevadafollowed the Humboldt River valley to obtain the water, grass and 'wood' neededby all travelers. Once in western Nevada and eastern California the pioneersworked out several paths over the rugged Sierra Nevada mountains into the goldfields, settlements and cities of western California.

While these areas share a primitive desert atmosphere, each retains its own character. The park covers 527.5 mi² (1,366 km²). Canyons are carved into the Colorado Plateau by the Colorado River and Green River.

It is 100 miles (160 km) long but fairly narrow. The park, established in 1971, preserves 378 mi² (979 km²) and is open all year, although May through September are the most popular months.<br><br>Called "Wayne Wonderland" in the 1920s by local boosters Ephraim P. Pectol and Joseph S. Hickman, Capitol Reef National Park protects colorful canyons, ridges, buttes, and monoliths. About 75 miles (120 km) of the long up-thrust called the Waterpocket Fold, extending like a rugged spine from Thousand Lake Mountain southward to Lake Powell, is preserved within the park boundary. Capitol Reef is the name of an especially rugged and spectacular part of the Waterpocket Fold near the Fremont River. The area was named for a line of white domes and cliffs of Navajo Sandstone, each of which looks somewhat like the United States Capitol building, that run from the Fremont River to Pleasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold. The local word reef referred to any rocky barrier to travel.<br><br>Only a few decades ago, Capitol Reef and the Waterpocket Fold country comprised one of the most remote corners of the lower 48 U.S. states. Easy road access came only with the construction of a paved State Route 24 through the Fremont River Canyon in 1962.

It is an example of an extinct cinder cone volcano that is part of the Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field. A paved road spirals around the volcano and visitors can drive up to a parking lot at the rim. Hiking trails circle the rim as well as lead down into the mouth of the volcano. Capulin Volcano National Monument is a well-preserved, relatively young (58,000 to 62,000 years old), symmetrical cinder cone. It rises steeply from the surrounding grassland plains to an elevation of 8,182 feet above sea level. The irregular rim of the crater is about a mile in circumference and the crater about 400 feet deep.<br><br>Capulin Volcano is one of the outstanding landmarks located in the northeast corner of New Mexico, where the rolling grasslands meet the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Capulin Volcano's highest point provides unobstructed, panoramic views of the volcanic field, distant snow-capped mountains, and portions of four states (New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado). Capulin Volcano also offers visitors excellent opportunities for observing and understanding volcanic formation. The large volcanic field surrounding the monument contains at least 100 recognizable volcanoes, and aids visitors in gaining insights into 10 million years of the geological history of northern New Mexico.

The national monument consists of the ruins of multiple structures surrounded by a compound wall constructed by the Hohokam, who farmed the Gila Valley in the early 1200s. "Casa Grande" is Spanish for "big house" (Siwan Wa'a Ki: in O'odham); these names refer to the largest structure on the site, which is what remains of a four story structure that may have been abandoned by the mid-1400s. The structure is made of caliche, and has managed to survive the extreme weather conditions for about seven centuries. Graffiti from 19th-century passers-by is scratched into its walls; though this is now illegal. Casa Grande now has a distinctive modern roof covering built in 1932.<br><br>Proclaimed Casa Grande Reservation by an order of President Benjamin Harrison on June 22, 1892 (Note this was long before the National Park Service).

It was known as Fort Marion from 1821 until 1942, and Fort St. Mark from 1763 until 1784 while under British control.<br><br>The city of St. Augustine was found by the Spanish in 1565. Over the next one hundred years, the city was defended by nine wooden forts. Following the 1668 attack of the English pirate Robert Searle, it was decided by the Queen Regent of Spain, Mariana, that a masonry fortification be constructed to protect the city. In October 1672 construction began on the fort that would become the Castillo de San Marcos.<br><br>The Castillo is a masonry star fort made of a stone called "coquina", literally "little shells", made of ancient shells that have bonded together to form a type of stone similar to limestone. Workers were brought in from Havana, Cuba, to construct the fort. The coquina was quarried from Anastasia Island across the bay from the Castillo, and ferried across to the construction site. Construction lasted twenty-three years, being completed in 1695. (Source Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castillo_de_San_Marcos))<br><br>http://www.nps.gov/casa]]></description>

It subsequently became a beer garden, a theater, the first immigration station (predating Ellis Island), a very popular public aquarium, and finally a national monument.<br><br>Construction began in 1808 and was completed in 1811. The fort, known as West Battery (sometimes South-west Battery), was designed by architects John McComb Jr. and Jonathan Williams. It was built on a small artificial island just off shore.<br><br>West Battery was intended to complement the three-tiered Castle Williams (still extant) on Governors Island, which was East Battery, to defend New York City from British forces in the tensions that marked the run-up to the War of 1812, but never saw action in that or any war. Subsequent landfill expanded Battery Park, and incorporated the fort into the mainland of Manhattan Island.<br><br>Although Castle Garden was designated a national monument on August 12, 1946, the law did not take effect until July 18, 1950, when the legislature and the governor of New York (Thomas Dewey) formally ceded ownership of the property to the Federal Government. A major rehabilitation took place in the 1970s. Today it is administered by the National Park Service and is a departure point for visitors to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. It appears much as it did in its earliest days, contains a museum, and is again called Castle Clinton.

Cedar Breaks is a natural amphitheater canyon, stretching across 3 miles (4.8 km), with a depth of over 2,000 feet (610 m). The elevation of the rim of the canyon is over 10,000 feet (3,000 m) above sea level.<br><br>The eroded rock of the canyon is similar to formations at Bryce Canyon National Park, but has its own distinct look. Because of its elevation, snow often makes it inaccessible to vehicles from October through May. Its canyon-rim visitor center, tiny compared to the visitor centers at nearby and better-known Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park, is open only from June through October, although park headquarters at a lower elevation in Zion is open the rest of the year. It is not as popular as some of the other National Parks, but still, several hundred thousand people visit annually.<br><br>Cedar Breaks National Monument was established in 1933. A small lodge, designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood and built and operated by the Utah Parks Company once existed near the south end of the monument, but it was razed in 1972. The Cedar Breaks Lodge was the smallest of the park lodges in the Southwest. It was deemed "uneconomical to operate" by the Park Service, but protests associated with its demolition caued the Park Service to re-examine its policies concerning lodges in other parks, contributing to their preservation.

Chacoans quarried sandstone blocks andhauled timber from great distances, assembling 15 major complexes whichremained the largest buildings in North America until the 19th century.Evidence of archaeoastronomy at Chaco has been proposed, with the Sun Daggerpetroglyph at Fajada Butte a popular example. Many Chacoan buildings may havebeen aligned to capture the solar and lunar cycles, requiring generations ofastronomical observations and centuries of skillfully coordinated construction.Climate change is thought to have led to the emigration of Chacoans and theeventual abandonment of the canyon, beginning with a 50-year drought in 1130.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>On March 11, 1907, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed ChacoCanyon National Monument.

In the 1980s, it was home tosome of the most difficult routes in the USA, mostly developed by Idaho climberTony Yaniro. Climbers in the region refer to the area as simply 'The City'.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The California Trail passed through what is now the City ofRocks. Wagons trains of the 1840s and 1850s left the Raft River valley andtraveled through the area and over Granite Pass into Nevada.

Spectacular canyons cut deep into sandstone and even granite–gneiss–schist rock formations, in some areas. This is an area of semi-desert land high on the Colorado Plateau, with pinion and juniper forests on the plateau. The park hosts a wide range of wildlife, including red-tailed hawks and golden eagles, ravens, jays, desert bighorn sheep, and coyotes.<br><br>Its feature attraction is Monument Canyon, which runs the width of the park, and includes rock formations such as Independence Monument, the Kissing Couple, and Coke Ovens. The monument includes 20,500 acres (32 square miles), much of which has been recommended to Congress for designation as wilderness.<br><br>The area was first explored by John Otto, a free spirit who settled in Grand Junction in the early 20th century. Prior to Otto's arrival, many area residents believed the canyons to be inaccessible to humans. Otto began building trails on the plateau and into the canyons. As word spread about his work, the Chamber of Commerce of Grand Junction sent a delegation to investigate. The delegation returned praising both Otto's work and the scenic beauty of the wilderness area, and the local newspaper began lobbying to make it a National Park (which it never did become). The area was established as Colorado National Monument on May 24, 1911. Otto was hired as the first park ranger, drawing a salary of $1 per month. For the next 16 years, he continued building and maintaining trails while living in a tent in the park.

Located in South Carolina, the park is 22,000 acre (89 km²). The lush trees growing in this floodplain forest are some of the tallest in the Eastern U.S., forming one of the highest natural canopies remaining in the world. Bald cypress is a common tree in the park. The Congaree River flows through the park. 15,000 acres (60.70 km²) or about 70 percent of the park is designated wilderness area.<br><br>While largely recognized as a sanctuary for animal and plant life, Congaree National Park features primitive campsites and offers hiking, canoeing, kayaking, and bird watching. Large animals possibly seen in the park include bobcats, black bears, deer, feral pigs, feral dogs, coyotes, and turkeys. Its waters contain interesting creatures like amphibians, turtles, snakes, alligators, and many types of fish like bowfin, largemouth bass, panfish, catfish, and pike. Primitive and backcountry camping is available. Hiking trails are found in the park as well as a 20-mile (32 km) marked canoe trail on Cedar Creek.<br><br>In 1969, the Sierra Club launched a grassroots campaign to save this area of old growth forest from private landowners interested in the relatively high timber prices. The result of this campaign was the establishment by Congress of Congaree Swamp National Monument on October 18, 1976. It became an International Biosphere Reserve on June 30, 1983. Over two-thirds of the park was designated a wilderness area on October 24, 1988, and it became an Important Bird Area on July 26, 2001. Following an increase in its authorized boundary, it became a national park on November 10, 2003.

The U.S. Navy built the Main Navyand Munitions Buildings as temporary offices on the land during World War I.The buildings were demolished in 1970 due in part to lobbying by PresidentRichard Nixon, who had served in the offices as a navy officer. President Nixonsubsequently ordered that a park be established on the land, and in 1976,Constitution Gardens was finally dedicated as a "living legacy AmericanRevolution Bicentennial tribute." It has been a separate park unit in theNational Park Service since 1982, administered under the National CapitolParks-Central (NACC).

This National Park was established on May 22, 1902, and it is the sixth oldest National Park in the U.S. This park encompasses the Crater Lake caldera, which rests in the remains of a destroyed volcano (eventually named Mount Mazama) and the surrounding forestland and hills. This is the only National Park in Oregon.<br><br>The lake is 1,949 feet (594 m) deep at its deepest point, which makes it the deepest lake in the United States, the second deepest in North America, and according to Wikipedia's list of lakes by depth, the ninth deepest anywhere in the world. However, when comparing its average depth of 1,148 feet (350 m) to the average depth of other deep lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third deepest in the world. The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical 4,000-foot (1,200 m) deep caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mt. Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the Cascade Mountains.<br><br>Crater Lake has no streams flowing into or out of it. All water that enters the lake is eventually lost from evaporation or subsurface seepage. The lake's water commonly has a striking blue hue, and the lake is re-filled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain.

The 51-square-mile (130 km2) park is the only national park in Ohio.<br>Cuyahoga means "crooked river" in Mohawk.<br><br>The valley began providing recreation for urban dwellers in the 1870s when people came from nearby cities for carriage rides or leisure boat trips along the canal. In 1880, the Valley Railroad became another way to escape urban industrial life. Actual park development began in the 1910s and 1920s with the establishment of Cleveland and Akron metropolitan park districts. In 1929 the estate of Cleveland businessman Hayward Kendall donated 430 acres around the Richie Ledges and a trust fund to the state of Ohio. Kendall's will stipulated that the "property should be perpetually used for park purposes". It became Virginia Kendall park, in honor of his mother. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps built much of the parks infrastructure including what are now Happy Days Lodge and the shelters at Octagon, Ledges, and Kendall Lake.<br><br>Although regional parks safeguarded certain places, by the 1960s local citizens feared that urban sprawl would overwhelm the Cuyahoga Valley's natural beauty. Active citizens joined forces with state and national government staff to find a long term solution. Finally, on December 27, 1974, President Gerald Ford signed the bill establishing the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. The area was redesignated a national park by Congress on October 11, 2000,[3] with the passage of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, House Bill 4578, 106th congress.

The park covers 5,262 square miles (13,630 km2), encompassing Saline Valley, a large part of Panamint Valley, almost all of Death Valley, and parts of several mountain ranges. Death Valley National Monument was declared a U.S. National Monument in 1933, placing the area under federal protection. In 1994, the monument was redesignated a national park, as well as being substantially expanded to include Saline and Eureka valleys.<br><br>It is the hottest and driest of the national parks in the United States. The second-lowest point in the Western Hemisphere and the lowest point in North America is in Badwater Basin, which is 282 feet (86 m) below sea level. The park is home to many species of plants and animals that have adapted to this harsh desert environment. Some examples include creosote bush, Bighorn Sheep, Coyote, and the Death Valley Pupfish, a survivor of much wetter times. Its wilderness area covers 4,774 square miles (12,360 km2), making it the largest in the Lower 48 states, and the sixth largest in the United States overall.

Middle DelawareNational Scenic River is a designated 40-mile (64 km) section of the riverentirely within the recreation area.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The park was originally conceived as part of a plan to builda dam on the Delaware River at Tocks Island, just north of the Water Gap. Thisdam would control water levels for hydroelectric power generation and create a37 mile lake in the center of present park for use as a reservoir. Starting in1960, the present day area of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Areawas acquired for the Army Corps of Engineers through eminent domain. Between3,000 and 5,000 dwellings were demolished, including historical sites, andabout 15,000 people were displaced by the project. Because of massiveenvironmental opposition, dwindling funds, and an unacceptable geologicalassessment of the dam's safety, the government transferred the property to theNational Park Service in 1978. The National Park Service found itself as thecaretaker of the previously endangered territory, and with the help of thefederal government and surrounding communities, developed recreationalfacilities and worked to preserve the remaining historical structures.

The postpile was created by a lava flow sometime between less than 100,000 years ago (according to current potassium-argon dating) to 700,000 years ago (according to other dating methods). The source of the lava is thought to have been somewhere near Upper Soda Springs campground at the north end of Pumice Flat on the floor of the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River, from where it flowed to the site of the Postpile, was impounded by a moraine, and reached a thickness of 400 feet (newer estimate) to 600 feet (older estimate). In any event, the lava that now makes up the Postpile was near the bottom of this mass.<br><br>Because of its great thickness, much of the mass of pooled lava cooled slowly and evenly, which is why the columns are so long and so symmetrical. Columnar jointing occurs when certain types of lava cool; the joints develop when the lava contracts during the cooling process. A glacier later removed much of this mass of rock and left a nicely polished surface on top of the Postpile with very noticeable glacial striations and glacial polish.

This park has fossils of dinosaurs including Allosaurus and various long-neck, long-tail sauropods. It was declared a National Monument on October 4, 1915.<br><br>The rock layer enclosing the fossils is a sandstone and conglomerate bed of alluvial or river bed origin known as the Morrison Formation from the Jurassic Period some 150 million years old. The dinosaurs and other ancient animals were washed into the area and buried presumably during flooding events. The pile of sediments were later buried and lithified into solid rock. The rock layers were later uplifted and tilted to their present angle by the mountain building forces that formed the Uintas. The relentless forces of erosion exposed the layers at the surface to be found by paleontologists.<br><br>Though lesser-known than the fossil beds, the petroglyphs in Dinosaur National Monument are another treasure the monument holds. Due to problems with vandals, many of the sites are not listed on area maps.

The park covers 101 mi² (262 km²), mostly water, about 68 statute miles (109 km) west of Key West in the Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>It is famous for abundant sea life, colorful coral reefs and legends of shipwrecks and sunken treasures. The park's centerpiece is Fort Jefferson, a massive but unfinished coastal fortress. It is the largest masonry structure in the Western Hemisphere, and is composed of over 16 million bricks. The park plays host to almost 80,000 visitors each year. The park is accessible only by seaplane or boat. Ferries leave from Key West. Activities include snorkeling, picnicking, scuba diving, saltwater fishing and birdwatching.<br><br>On January 4, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who visited the area by ship, designated the area as Fort Jefferson National Monument. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 10, 1970. On October 26, 1992 the Dry Tortugas, including Fort Jefferson, was established as a National Park. The islands still do not exhibit any standing fresh water or even seasonal streams, hence the "dry" name.

The rooms of the house are left inarrested decay and are not furnished to look like they did during Poe's time.The neighboring residences include a welcome area, gift shop, a film screeningroom, and some minor exhibits. The site also includes a reading room decoratedbased on Poe's theories in "The Philosophy of Furniture". This, theonly room on the site furnished to look like the 19th century, is not part ofPoe's original home and is not meant to suggest Poe had a similarly decoratedroom. The room includes a complete collection of Poe's works, includingcriticism, and audio interpretations of his work. A statue outside of the homedepicts a large raven, representative of one of Poe's most famous poems,"The Raven" (1845). The cellar in the house resembles one describedin "The Black Cat" (1843), also written while Poe lived inPhiladelphia. Though the house does not include any items originally owned bythe Poe family, many items are collected nearby at the Free Library ofPhiladelphia.

The main feature of this National Monument is a great sandstone promontory with a pool of water at its base. As a shaded oasis in the western U.S. desert, this site has seen many centuries of travelers. The Spaniard explorers called it El Morro (The Headland). The Zuni Indians call it "A'ts'ina" (Place of writings on the rock). Anglo-Americans called it Inscription Rock. Travelers left signatures, names, dates, and stories of their treks. While some of the inscriptions are fading, there are still many that can be seen today, some dating to the 17th century. Some petroglyphs and carvings were made by the Anasazi centuries before Europeans started making their mark. In 1906, U.S. federal law prohibited further carving.

The largest subtropical wilderness in the United States, it contains the southern 25 percent of the original Everglades marshland region of southwestern Florida. It is visited by one million people each year, and it is the third-largest national park in the lower 48 states after Death Valley National Park and Yellowstone National Park. It has been declared an International Biosphere Reserve, a World Heritage Site, and a Wetland of International Importance, only one of three locations in the world to appear on all three lists.<br><br>Unlike most other U.S. national parks, Everglades National Park was created to protect a fragile ecosystem instead of safeguarding a geographic feature. Thirty-six species designated as threatened or protected live in the park, including the Florida panther, the American crocodile, and the West Indian manatee.<br><br>The Everglades is a slow-moving system of rivers, flowing southwest at about .25 miles (0.40 km) per day, fed by the Kissimmee River and Lake Okeechobee. Although humans have lived in the Everglades for thousands of years, it was not until 1882 that the region began to be drained for agricultural or residential use, and the water flow from Lake Okeechobee was controlled, and diverted to the South Florida metropolitan area. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and the repair and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.

It is located in a mountain valley just west of Pikes Peak and holds spectacular remnants of prehistoric life.<br><br>The fossils are contained in the Florissant Formation of Eocene age. Huge petrified redwoods and very detailed fossils of ancient insects and plants reveal a very different landscape in Colorado of long ago. Almost 35 million years ago, enormous volcanic eruptions buried the then-lush valley and petrified the redwood trees that grew there. A lake formed in the valley and the fine-grained sediments at its bottom became the final resting-place for thousands of insects and plants. These sediments compacted into layers of shale and preserved the delicate details of these organisms as fossils. Many of the insect species found therein were described by the entomologist Theodore Cockerell. The Florissant Fossil Beds were set aside as a part of the National Park System in 1969.<br><br>Florissant means "flowering" in French, and the Florissant Fossil Beds are notable for thir beautiful fossilized plant life.

FortDavis is important in understanding the presence of African Americans in theWest and in the frontier military because the 24th and 25th U.S. Infantry andthe 9th and 10th U.S. Cavalry, all-black regiments (known as the BuffaloSoldiers), which were established after the American Civil War, were stationedat the post.<br><br><br><br>Today,twenty-four restored historic buildings and over 100 ruins and foundations arepart of Fort Davis National Historic Site. Five of the historic buildings havebeen refurnished to the 1880s, making it easy for visitors to envisionthemselves being at the fort at the height of its development.

Grant and Admiral Andrew Hull Foote captured threeConfederate forts, opened two rivers to the Union navy, and received nationalrecognition for their victories in February 1862, the first major Unionsuccesses of the war. The main portion of the park, in Dover, Tennessee,commemorates the Battle of Fort Donelson, one of the most influential battlesin American history. Fort Heiman, in nearby Calloway County, Kentucky, was aConfederate battery in the Battle of Fort Henry.<br><br><br><br>Thesite was established as Fort Donelson National Military Park on March 26, 1928.The park preserves much of the original battle site, including the riverbatteries and the eroded remains of the fort itself, but the area in which theConfederate States Army assaulted on February 15, 1862, is largely in privatehands, occupied by residential development. The Cumberland River was dammed inthe 1960s and this area is currently referred to as Lake Barkley. It covers anarea roughly similar to the original river while at flood stage, as it wasduring the battle. Fort Donelson National Cemetery, at 15.34 acres (62,080 m²),contains 670 Union dead, reinterred in 1867. There are also numerous veteransfrom later wars. The cemetery is presently unavailable for further burials. (Source Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Donelson_National_Battlefield))<br><br><br><br>http://www.nps.gov/fodo]]></description>

During the middle 19th century, it was a primarystopping point on the Oregon Trail and the Mormon Trail and was, along withBent's Fort on the Arkansas River, the most significant economic hub ofcommerce in the region. In the 1840s it was taken over by the United StatesArmy to protect travelers on the Oregon, California and Mormon trails.<br><br><br><br>Afterthe completion of the transcontinental railroad, the fort's importancedecreased rapidly until it was decommissioned in 1890. The original abandonmentorder was issued in 1889, and four of the infantry companies stationed there atthat time went to Fort Logan, near Denver, Colorado that fall. In March, 1890,about 30 cavalry soldiers and civilian mechanics under the command of Lt. C. W.Taylor arrived at the fort and removed doors, windows, flooring, and any othermaterial from the buildings that was thought to be of value to the government.The last soldiers left Fort Laramie on April 20, 1890. All but one of thestructures were sold at auction to private citizens, and the entire militaryreservation, which was nine miles long and six miles wide, was opened up tohomesteaders for settlement on October 5, 1891.

The Monument consists of a 1740 Spanish fort, Fort Matanzas, and about 100 acres (0.4 km²) of salt marsh and barrier islands along the Matanzas River on the northern Atlantic coast of Florida.<br><br>Fort Matanzas guards Matanzas Inlet, the southern mouth of the Matanzas River, which can be used as a rear entrance to the city of St. Augustine. Such an approach avoids St. Augustine's primary defense system centered at Castillo de San Marcos. In 1740, Gov. James Oglethorpe of Georgia used the inlet to blockade St. Augustine and launch a 39 day siege. St. Augustine endured the siege but the Spanish realized the need to protect the inlet. Under Gov. Manuel de Montiano construction began in 1740 with completion occurring in 1742.<br><br>The Fort is constructed of coquina, a common shellstone building material in the area. It is 50 feet (15 m) long on each side with a 30-foot (9.1 m) tower. The marshy terrain was stabilized by a foundation of pine pilings. The standard staff for the Fort was one officer in charge, four infantrymen, and two gunners, though more troops could be stationed if necessary. All soldiers at Fort Matanzas served on rotation from their regular duty in St. Augustine. Five cannons were placed at the Fort - four six pounders and one 18 pounder. All guns could reach the inlet, which at the time was less than a half mile away.

It was during thisbombardment of the fort that Francis Scott Key was inspired to write "TheStar-Spangled Banner," the poem that would eventually be set to the tuneof the The Anacreontic Song, to become the national anthem of the UnitedStates.<br><br><br><br>Designedby Frenchman Jean Foncin in 1798 and named after James McHenry, a Scots-Irishimmigrant and surgeon-soldier who became Secretary of War under PresidentWashington, Fort McHenry was built after America won its independence to defendthe important Port of Baltimore from future enemy attacks. It was positioned onthe Locust Point peninsula which juts into the opening of Baltimore Harbor, andwas constructed in the form of a five-pointed star surrounded by a dry moat — adeep, broad trench. The moat would serve as a shelter from which musketmenmight defend the fort from a land attack. In case of such an attack on thisfirst line of defense, each point, or bastion, was fortified, so that theinvading army would be caught in a crossfire of cannon and musket fire.

The fort is best known as the site upon which the shots initiating the American Civil War were fired, at the Battle of Fort Sumter.<br><br>When the Civil War ended, Fort Sumter was in ruins. The U.S. Army worked to restore it as a useful military installation. The damaged walls were re-leveled to a lower height and partially rebuilt. The third tier of gun emplacements was removed. Eleven of the original first-tier gun rooms were restored with 100-pounder Parrott rifles. During World War I, a small garrison manned the two twelve-inch (305 mm) rifles at Battery Huger. Until World War II, the fort was unused except as a tourist destination; two 90 mm antiaircraft guns were then installed. Fort Sumter became a U.S. National Monument in 1948.
