Originally inhabited by the Wabanakipeople, the area includes mountains, an ocean shoreline, woodlands, and lakes.In addition to Mount Desert Island, the park comprises much of the Isle auHaut, a small island to the southwest of Mount Desert Island and parts of BakerIsland, also nearby. A portion of Schoodic Peninsula on the mainland is alsopart of the park. In total, Acadia National Park consists of 30,300 acres (47square miles or 123 km2) on Mount Desert Island, 2,728 acres (4.6 square milesor 11 km2) on Isle au Haut and 2,366 acres (3.5 square miles or 9.2 km2) on theSchoodic Peninsula.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thelandscape architect Charles Elliot is credited with the idea for the park. Itfirst attained federal status when President Woodrow Wilson, established it asSieur de Monts National Monument on July 8, 1916, administered by the NationalPark Service. On February 26, 1919, it became a national park, with the nameLafayette National Park in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette, an influentialFrench supporter of the American Revolution. The park's name was changed toAcadia National Park on January 19, 1929. From 1915 to 1933, the wealthy philanthropistJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr. financed, designed, and directed the construction of anetwork of carriage trails throughout the park. The network encompassed over 50miles (80 km) of gravel carriage trails, 17 granite bridges, and two gatelodges, almost all of which are still maintained and in use today. Cut granitestones placed along the edges of the carriage roads act as guard rails of sortand are locally known as "coping stones" to help visitors cope withthe steep edges. They are also fondly called "Rockefeller's teeth".

The main feature of the Monument is a valley of the Niobrara River, and the fossils found on Carnegie Hill and University Hill. The area largely consists of grass-covered plains. Plants on the site include prairie sandreed, blue grama, little bluestem and needle and thread grass, and the wildflowers lupin, spiderwort, western wallflower and sunflowers. The site is best known for the large number of well-preserved Miocene fossils, many of which were found at dig sites on Carnegie and University Hills. Fossils from the site, which date from about 20 million years ago, are among some of the best specimens of Miocene mammals. <br><br>Originally the Agate Springs Ranch, a working cattle ranch, was owned by Capt. James Cook. The monument's museum collection also contains more than 500 artifacts from the Cook Collection of Plains Indian artifacts. The national monument was authorized on June 5, 1965, but was not established until June 14, 1997.

It has a catchment area of approximately 1400 square mi (3600 km²). It is located in central Lake and Peninsula Borough. In Yupik, the word "Alagnak" means "to err." Every year, the river changes its course and branches anew, for which reason it is sometimes called the "Branch River."<br><br>Due to the large numbers of salmon, there is a significant bear population in the summer and fall, including both grizzly and black bears. The majority of the catchment area is a winter habitat for Alaskan caribou. Moose are also to be found during the entire year. Along the river, beaver, foxes, wolverines, mink, and otter are all found as well occasional wolf. In the water, there are several varieties of salmon, including sockeye salmon, pink salmon, chum salmon, king salmon, and silver salmon. There are also rainbow trout, char, arctic grayling, and northern pike. Along the river there is also eclectic vegetation including spruces, willows and various types of berries.<br><br>The upper 67 mi (108 km) of the river is designated as a protected "wild and scenic river" in accordance with ANILCA, the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act. This part of the river is known as the Alagnak Wild River. (Source Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alagnak_Wild_River))<br><br>http://www.nps.gov/alag]]></description>

It offers visitors a glimpse of both natural and cultural history, and traces the historic footprints of the U.S. Army Base, Fort Schwatka, located at the Ulakta Head on Mount Ballyhoo. The fort, 800 miles west of Anchorage, the nearest large urban center, was one of four coastal defense posts built to protect Dutch Harbor (crucial back door to the United States) during World War II; Fort Schwatka is also the highest coastal battery ever constructed in the United States. Engineers designed the concrete observation posts and command stations to withstand earthquakes and 100 mph winds. Although today, many of the bunkers and wooden structures of Fort Schwatka have collapsed, the gun mounts and lookouts are among the most intact in the country.<br><br>In 1996, the United State Congress designated this a National Historic Area as a way of educating future generations both about the history of the Aleut people, and the role the Aleutian Islands played in the defense of the United States in World War II.

It was a series of 10 inclines, approximately 36 miles (58 km) long, and operated from 1834 to 1854. It connected two canal divisions of the Main Line of Public Works of the Pennsylvania Canal from Johnstown on the west to Hollidaysburg on the east, thus allowing continuous barge traffic between the Ohio and the Susquehanna rivers. Considered a technological marvel in its day, it played a critical role in opening the interior of the United States beyond the Appalachian Mountains to settlement and commerce. It included the first railroad tunnel in the United States, the Staple Bend Tunnel, and its inauguration was marked with great fanfare.<br><br>Today, the remains of the railroad are preserved within the Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site operated by the National Park Service. The site was established on 1,296 acres (524 ha) in 1964 and is about 12 miles (19.3 km) west of Altoona,[citation needed] in Blair and Cambria counties.

"Amistad" is Spanish for "friendship", as the Amistad Reservoir is located on the border with Mexico. The reservoir was created by Amistad Dam in 1969.<br><br>The lake provides year-round, water-based recreation opportunities, including boating, fishing, swimming, scuba diving and water-skiing, as well as other recreational opportunities for picnicking, camping and hunting. The area is rich in archeology and rock art, and contains a wide variety of plant and animal life. For highly experienced scuba divers, there is a system of deep underwater caves that can be accessed. The dive includes exotic gas mixes, pre-placement of gas cylinders, and extensive decompression times at depth. These caves are considered extremely hazardous and should not be attempted by anyone without extensive training and preparation.<br><br>The site was administered under a cooperative agreement with the International Boundary and Water Commission as Amistad Recreation Area, November 11, 1965. It was authorized as a National Recreation Area on November 28, 1990.

It is known for its collection of historic lighthouses, sandstone sea caves, a few old growth remnant forests, and natural animal habitats.<br><br>The Apostle Islands are a result of the glaciers that once covered North America. “Geologically they are originally part of the main land at the edge of the great riff or fault which formed the depression to which the waters of Lake Superior collected.” When the glaciers melted, waves from the waters of Lake Superior caused erosion that formed the islands. The islands are composed of mostly red sandstone because of the glacial shift.<br><br>It is widely assumed that Indians were the first to inhabit the island. “There is some evidence that they were seen and possibly visited sometime in the fourteenth century by Indians who were making their way to Isle Royale near the north shore of the land in search of copper.” Not long after, the islands were visited by Étienne Brûlé, a French explorer who, like many French Canadians, was trying to discover a new way to the East Indies. "The French are believed to have named the islands 'Apostle' meaning 12, because they believed in the practice of giving names of religious significance to geographic locations." It is said that fur traders were the first explorers to settle in the area, building a village from the money they brought in.<br><br>United States Senator Gaylord Nelson sponsored the federal legislation that established the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Public Law 91-424 was signed by the President on September 26, 1970. It included 20 islands, a 12-mile strip of the mainland, and approximately 1/4 mile of Lake Superior jurisdiction adjacent to each land unit. After the National Park Service completed a wilderness study in 2004, and received overwhelming support from the public, Congress designated 80% of the land area of the national lakeshore as the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness on December 8, 2004.

Lee Memorial, also known asthe Custis-Lee Mansion, is a Greek revival style mansion located inArlington, Virginia, USA and was once the home of Confederate General Robert E.Lee. It overlooks the Potomac River, directly across from the National Mall inWashington, D.C. During the American Civil War, the grounds of the mansion wereselected as the site of Arlington National Cemetery, in part to ensure that Leewould never again be able to return to his home. However, the United States hassince designated the mansion as a National Memorial to its former opponent, amark of widespread respect for him in both the North and South.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The federal government had confiscated the mansion property,in 1864, claiming that property taxes had not been paid. Robert E. Lee and hiswife never legally challenged the return of the home. In 1870, after hisfather's death, George Washington Custis Lee, the eldest son of Robert E. Lee,filed a lawsuit in the Alexandria Circuit Court which resulted in a laterSupreme Court decision in 1882 awarding Custis Lee just compensation for thehouse and 1,100 acres (4 km2). Lee originally asked for $300,000, however, thecourt only awarded $150,000, considered the fair market value of the property.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Congress designated the mansion as a memorial to Lee in 1955, and it wasplaced on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.

TheNational Preserve protects a remnant of the Bering Land Bridge that connectedAsia with North America more than 13,000 years ago during the Pleistocene iceage. The majority of this land bridge, once thousands of miles wide, now liesbeneath the waters of the Chukchi and Bering Seas.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>During the glacial epoch this was part of a migration routefor people, animals, and plants whenever ocean levels fell enough to expose theland bridge. Archeologists agree that it was across this Bering Land Bridge,also called Beringia, that humans first migrated from Asia to populate theAmericas.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The preserve was originally established on December 1, 1978,as Bering Land Bridge National Monument. On December 2, 1980, the designationwas changed to a National Preserve. The Preserve's western boundary lies 42miles from the Bering Strait and the fishing boundary between the United Statesand Russia. There are no roads into the preserve. Access to the preserve is bybush planes or boats during summer months and by ski planes, snowmobiles or dogsleds during the winter.

For more than 1,000 miles (1600 km), the Rio Grande / Río Bravo forms the international boundary between Mexico and the United States, and Big Bend National Park administers approximately 244 miles (393 km) along that boundary.<br><br>Big Bend National Park has national significance as the largest protected area of Chihuahuan Desert topography and ecology in the United States, which includes more than 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds, 56 species of reptiles, and 75 species of mammals. The park covers 801,163 acres (3,242 km2). Few areas exceed the park's value for the protection and study of geologic and paleontologic resources. Cretaceous and Tertiary fossil organisms exist in variety and abundance. Archeologists have discovered artifacts estimated to be 9,000 years old, and historic buildings and landscapes offer graphic illustration of life along the international border in the 1800s.<br><br>Because the Rio Grande serves as an international boundary, the park faces unusual constraints when administering and enforcing park rules, regulations, and policies. In accordance with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the park has jurisdiction only to the center of the deepest river channel as the river flowed in 1848. The rest of the land south of that channel, and the river, lies within Mexican territory.

While no exact boundaries exist, the area occupies much ofHardin County, Liberty, Tyler, San Jacinto, and Polk Counties and is roughlybounded by the San Jacinto River, Neches River, and Pine Island Bayou.

The Big Thicket National Preserve wasestablished in 1974 in an attempt to protect the many plant and animal specieswithin. Big Thicket National Preserve, along with Big Cypress National Preservein Florida, became the first national preserves in the United States NationalPark System when both were authorized by the United States Congress on 11October 1974. Big Thicket was also designated as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCOin 1981.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>A dirt road leading north out of the town of Saratoga is thecore of the area's predominant ghost story. Bragg Road, as it is more formallyknown, was constructed in 1934 on the bed of a former railroad line that hadserviced the lumber industry. In the 1940s, stories began to circulate about a mysteriouslight, sometimes referred to as the Light of Saratoga, that could be seen onand near the road at night. No adequate explanation of the light has beenoffered. The various ghost stories include reference to the Kaiser Burnout,long-dead conquistadors looking for their buried treasure, a decapitated railroadworker, and a lost night hunter eternally searching for a way out. Less paranormal explanations include swamp gas, andautomobile headlights filtering through the trees.

This dam, named after the famousCrow chairman Robert Yellowtail, harnessed the waters of the Bighorn River andturned this variable stream into a lake. Archeological and historical resourcescomplement the natural scene. About one third of the area is within the CrowIndian Reservation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bighorn Lake extends 71 miles (114 km) through Wyoming andMontana, 55 miles (89 km) of which are held within spectacular Bighorn Canyon.The Recreation Area straddles the northern Wyoming and southern Montanaborders. There are two visitor centers and other developed facilities; one inFort Smith, Montana, and one near Lovell, Wyoming. The Afterbay Lake below theYellowtail Dam is a good spot for trout fishing and wildlife viewing for ducks,geese, and other animals. The Bighorn River below the Afterbay Dam is a worldclass trout fishing area. North of Lovell, there is a spot where one can standon the canyon rim, shout, and hear a "triple echo."

The park preserves Biscayne Bay, one of the top scuba diving areas in the United States. Ninety-five percent of the park is water. In addition, the shore of the bay is the location of an extensive mangrove forest. The park covers 207 mi² (700 km²).<br><br>Elliott Key, the park's largest island, is considered the first of the true Florida Keys being formed from fossilized coral reef, i.e. Key Largo limestone. The islands farther north in the park are transitional islands of coral and sand.<br><br>The major attraction of the park is scuba diving or snorkeling on the coral reef inside the bay. It is also possible to take a glass-bottom boat tour of the bay, or rent kayaks to explore the bay and the islands (Florida Keys) in it. While accessing the historic homes of Stiltsville is currently not allowed by casual visitors, these structures may still be observed from boats.
