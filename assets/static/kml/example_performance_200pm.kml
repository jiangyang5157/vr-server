This National Park was established on May 22, 1902, and it is the sixth oldest National Park in the U.S. This park encompasses the Crater Lake caldera, which rests in the remains of a destroyed volcano (eventually named Mount Mazama) and the surrounding forestland and hills. This is the only National Park in Oregon.<br><br>The lake is 1,949 feet (594 m) deep at its deepest point, which makes it the deepest lake in the United States, the second deepest in North America, and according to Wikipedia's list of lakes by depth, the ninth deepest anywhere in the world. However, when comparing its average depth of 1,148 feet (350 m) to the average depth of other deep lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third deepest in the world. The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical 4,000-foot (1,200 m) deep caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mt. Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the Cascade Mountains.<br><br>Crater Lake has no streams flowing into or out of it. All water that enters the lake is eventually lost from evaporation or subsurface seepage. The lake's water commonly has a striking blue hue, and the lake is re-filled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain.

The 51-square-mile (130 km2) park is the only national park in Ohio.<br>Cuyahoga means "crooked river" in Mohawk.<br><br>The valley began providing recreation for urban dwellers in the 1870s when people came from nearby cities for carriage rides or leisure boat trips along the canal. In 1880, the Valley Railroad became another way to escape urban industrial life. Actual park development began in the 1910s and 1920s with the establishment of Cleveland and Akron metropolitan park districts. In 1929 the estate of Cleveland businessman Hayward Kendall donated 430 acres around the Richie Ledges and a trust fund to the state of Ohio. Kendall's will stipulated that the "property should be perpetually used for park purposes". It became Virginia Kendall park, in honor of his mother. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps built much of the parks infrastructure including what are now Happy Days Lodge and the shelters at Octagon, Ledges, and Kendall Lake.<br><br>Although regional parks safeguarded certain places, by the 1960s local citizens feared that urban sprawl would overwhelm the Cuyahoga Valley's natural beauty. Active citizens joined forces with state and national government staff to find a long term solution. Finally, on December 27, 1974, President Gerald Ford signed the bill establishing the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. The area was redesignated a national park by Congress on October 11, 2000,[3] with the passage of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, House Bill 4578, 106th congress.

The park covers 5,262 square miles (13,630 km2), encompassing Saline Valley, a large part of Panamint Valley, almost all of Death Valley, and parts of several mountain ranges. Death Valley National Monument was declared a U.S. National Monument in 1933, placing the area under federal protection. In 1994, the monument was redesignated a national park, as well as being substantially expanded to include Saline and Eureka valleys.<br><br>It is the hottest and driest of the national parks in the United States. The second-lowest point in the Western Hemisphere and the lowest point in North America is in Badwater Basin, which is 282 feet (86 m) below sea level. The park is home to many species of plants and animals that have adapted to this harsh desert environment. Some examples include creosote bush, Bighorn Sheep, Coyote, and the Death Valley Pupfish, a survivor of much wetter times. Its wilderness area covers 4,774 square miles (12,360 km2), making it the largest in the Lower 48 states, and the sixth largest in the United States overall.

Middle DelawareNational Scenic River is a designated 40-mile (64 km) section of the riverentirely within the recreation area.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The park was originally conceived as part of a plan to builda dam on the Delaware River at Tocks Island, just north of the Water Gap. Thisdam would control water levels for hydroelectric power generation and create a37 mile lake in the center of present park for use as a reservoir. Starting in1960, the present day area of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Areawas acquired for the Army Corps of Engineers through eminent domain. Between3,000 and 5,000 dwellings were demolished, including historical sites, andabout 15,000 people were displaced by the project. Because of massiveenvironmental opposition, dwindling funds, and an unacceptable geologicalassessment of the dam's safety, the government transferred the property to theNational Park Service in 1978. The National Park Service found itself as thecaretaker of the previously endangered territory, and with the help of thefederal government and surrounding communities, developed recreationalfacilities and worked to preserve the remaining historical structures.

The park and preserve together cover 9,492 mi² (24,585 km²).<br><br><br><br><br><br>The word "Denali" means "the great one"in the native Athabaskan language and refers to the mountain itself. Themountain was named after president William McKinley of Ohio in 1897 by localprospector William A. Dickey, although McKinley had no connection with theregion. <br><br><br><br><br><br>The park is serviced by a 91-mile (146 km) road from theGeorge Parks Highway to the mining camp of Kantishna. It runs east to west,north of and roughly parallel to the imposing Alaska Range. Only a smallfraction of the road is paved because permafrost and the freeze-thaw cyclecreate an enormous cost for maintaining the road. Only the first 15 miles (24km) of the road are available to private vehicles, and beyond this pointvisitors must access the interior of the park through concessionary buses.Wonder Lake can be reached by a six-hour bus ride from the Wilderness AccessCenter. Eielson Visitor Center is located four hours into the park on the road.(Source Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denali_National_Park_and_Preserve))<br><br><br>http://www.nps.gov/dena]]></description>

The postpile was created by a lava flow sometime between less than 100,000 years ago (according to current potassium-argon dating) to 700,000 years ago (according to other dating methods). The source of the lava is thought to have been somewhere near Upper Soda Springs campground at the north end of Pumice Flat on the floor of the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River, from where it flowed to the site of the Postpile, was impounded by a moraine, and reached a thickness of 400 feet (newer estimate) to 600 feet (older estimate). In any event, the lava that now makes up the Postpile was near the bottom of this mass.<br><br>Because of its great thickness, much of the mass of pooled lava cooled slowly and evenly, which is why the columns are so long and so symmetrical. Columnar jointing occurs when certain types of lava cool; the joints develop when the lava contracts during the cooling process. A glacier later removed much of this mass of rock and left a nicely polished surface on top of the Postpile with very noticeable glacial striations and glacial polish.

This park has fossils of dinosaurs including Allosaurus and various long-neck, long-tail sauropods. It was declared a National Monument on October 4, 1915.<br><br>The rock layer enclosing the fossils is a sandstone and conglomerate bed of alluvial or river bed origin known as the Morrison Formation from the Jurassic Period some 150 million years old. The dinosaurs and other ancient animals were washed into the area and buried presumably during flooding events. The pile of sediments were later buried and lithified into solid rock. The rock layers were later uplifted and tilted to their present angle by the mountain building forces that formed the Uintas. The relentless forces of erosion exposed the layers at the surface to be found by paleontologists.<br><br>Though lesser-known than the fossil beds, the petroglyphs in Dinosaur National Monument are another treasure the monument holds. Due to problems with vandals, many of the sites are not listed on area maps.

The park covers 101 mi² (262 km²), mostly water, about 68 statute miles (109 km) west of Key West in the Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>It is famous for abundant sea life, colorful coral reefs and legends of shipwrecks and sunken treasures. The park's centerpiece is Fort Jefferson, a massive but unfinished coastal fortress. It is the largest masonry structure in the Western Hemisphere, and is composed of over 16 million bricks. The park plays host to almost 80,000 visitors each year. The park is accessible only by seaplane or boat. Ferries leave from Key West. Activities include snorkeling, picnicking, scuba diving, saltwater fishing and birdwatching.<br><br>On January 4, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who visited the area by ship, designated the area as Fort Jefferson National Monument. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 10, 1970. On October 26, 1992 the Dry Tortugas, including Fort Jefferson, was established as a National Park. The islands still do not exhibit any standing fresh water or even seasonal streams, hence the "dry" name.

The rooms of the house are left inarrested decay and are not furnished to look like they did during Poe's time.The neighboring residences include a welcome area, gift shop, a film screeningroom, and some minor exhibits. The site also includes a reading room decoratedbased on Poe's theories in "The Philosophy of Furniture". This, theonly room on the site furnished to look like the 19th century, is not part ofPoe's original home and is not meant to suggest Poe had a similarly decoratedroom. The room includes a complete collection of Poe's works, includingcriticism, and audio interpretations of his work. A statue outside of the homedepicts a large raven, representative of one of Poe's most famous poems,"The Raven" (1845). The cellar in the house resembles one describedin "The Black Cat" (1843), also written while Poe lived inPhiladelphia. Though the house does not include any items originally owned bythe Poe family, many items are collected nearby at the Free Library ofPhiladelphia.

It is named El Malpais (Spanish for badlands) due tothe extremely rough, rugged lava flow that covers much of the park. The lavaflows fill a large basin rimmed by higher sandstone that forms large, wind-carvedbluffs around much of the malpais. The terrain is so rocky in some parts thattrails cannot be constructed in the usual manner; cairns have been constructedto guide hikers.

The main feature of this National Monument is a great sandstone promontory with a pool of water at its base. As a shaded oasis in the western U.S. desert, this site has seen many centuries of travelers. The Spaniard explorers called it El Morro (The Headland). The Zuni Indians call it "A'ts'ina" (Place of writings on the rock). Anglo-Americans called it Inscription Rock. Travelers left signatures, names, dates, and stories of their treks. While some of the inscriptions are fading, there are still many that can be seen today, some dating to the 17th century. Some petroglyphs and carvings were made by the Anasazi centuries before Europeans started making their mark. In 1906, U.S. federal law prohibited further carving.

The largest subtropical wilderness in the United States, it contains the southern 25 percent of the original Everglades marshland region of southwestern Florida. It is visited by one million people each year, and it is the third-largest national park in the lower 48 states after Death Valley National Park and Yellowstone National Park. It has been declared an International Biosphere Reserve, a World Heritage Site, and a Wetland of International Importance, only one of three locations in the world to appear on all three lists.<br><br>Unlike most other U.S. national parks, Everglades National Park was created to protect a fragile ecosystem instead of safeguarding a geographic feature. Thirty-six species designated as threatened or protected live in the park, including the Florida panther, the American crocodile, and the West Indian manatee.<br><br>The Everglades is a slow-moving system of rivers, flowing southwest at about .25 miles (0.40 km) per day, fed by the Kissimmee River and Lake Okeechobee. Although humans have lived in the Everglades for thousands of years, it was not until 1882 that the region began to be drained for agricultural or residential use, and the water flow from Lake Okeechobee was controlled, and diverted to the South Florida metropolitan area. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and the repair and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.

It is located in a mountain valley just west of Pikes Peak and holds spectacular remnants of prehistoric life.<br><br>The fossils are contained in the Florissant Formation of Eocene age. Huge petrified redwoods and very detailed fossils of ancient insects and plants reveal a very different landscape in Colorado of long ago. Almost 35 million years ago, enormous volcanic eruptions buried the then-lush valley and petrified the redwood trees that grew there. A lake formed in the valley and the fine-grained sediments at its bottom became the final resting-place for thousands of insects and plants. These sediments compacted into layers of shale and preserved the delicate details of these organisms as fossils. Many of the insect species found therein were described by the entomologist Theodore Cockerell. The Florissant Fossil Beds were set aside as a part of the National Park System in 1969.<br><br>Florissant means "flowering" in French, and the Florissant Fossil Beds are notable for thir beautiful fossilized plant life.

Grant and Admiral Andrew Hull Foote captured threeConfederate forts, opened two rivers to the Union navy, and received nationalrecognition for their victories in February 1862, the first major Unionsuccesses of the war. The main portion of the park, in Dover, Tennessee,commemorates the Battle of Fort Donelson, one of the most influential battlesin American history. Fort Heiman, in nearby Calloway County, Kentucky, was aConfederate battery in the Battle of Fort Henry.<br><br><br><br>Thesite was established as Fort Donelson National Military Park on March 26, 1928.The park preserves much of the original battle site, including the riverbatteries and the eroded remains of the fort itself, but the area in which theConfederate States Army assaulted on February 15, 1862, is largely in privatehands, occupied by residential development. The Cumberland River was dammed inthe 1960s and this area is currently referred to as Lake Barkley. It covers anarea roughly similar to the original river while at flood stage, as it wasduring the battle. Fort Donelson National Cemetery, at 15.34 acres (62,080 m²),contains 670 Union dead, reinterred in 1867. There are also numerous veteransfrom later wars. The cemetery is presently unavailable for further burials. (Source Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Donelson_National_Battlefield))<br><br><br><br>http://www.nps.gov/fodo]]></description>

During the middle 19th century, it was a primarystopping point on the Oregon Trail and the Mormon Trail and was, along withBent's Fort on the Arkansas River, the most significant economic hub ofcommerce in the region. In the 1840s it was taken over by the United StatesArmy to protect travelers on the Oregon, California and Mormon trails.<br><br><br><br>Afterthe completion of the transcontinental railroad, the fort's importancedecreased rapidly until it was decommissioned in 1890. The original abandonmentorder was issued in 1889, and four of the infantry companies stationed there atthat time went to Fort Logan, near Denver, Colorado that fall. In March, 1890,about 30 cavalry soldiers and civilian mechanics under the command of Lt. C. W.Taylor arrived at the fort and removed doors, windows, flooring, and any othermaterial from the buildings that was thought to be of value to the government.The last soldiers left Fort Laramie on April 20, 1890. All but one of thestructures were sold at auction to private citizens, and the entire militaryreservation, which was nine miles long and six miles wide, was opened up tohomesteaders for settlement on October 5, 1891.

The Monument consists of a 1740 Spanish fort, Fort Matanzas, and about 100 acres (0.4 km²) of salt marsh and barrier islands along the Matanzas River on the northern Atlantic coast of Florida.<br><br>Fort Matanzas guards Matanzas Inlet, the southern mouth of the Matanzas River, which can be used as a rear entrance to the city of St. Augustine. Such an approach avoids St. Augustine's primary defense system centered at Castillo de San Marcos. In 1740, Gov. James Oglethorpe of Georgia used the inlet to blockade St. Augustine and launch a 39 day siege. St. Augustine endured the siege but the Spanish realized the need to protect the inlet. Under Gov. Manuel de Montiano construction began in 1740 with completion occurring in 1742.<br><br>The Fort is constructed of coquina, a common shellstone building material in the area. It is 50 feet (15 m) long on each side with a 30-foot (9.1 m) tower. The marshy terrain was stabilized by a foundation of pine pilings. The standard staff for the Fort was one officer in charge, four infantrymen, and two gunners, though more troops could be stationed if necessary. All soldiers at Fort Matanzas served on rotation from their regular duty in St. Augustine. Five cannons were placed at the Fort - four six pounders and one 18 pounder. All guns could reach the inlet, which at the time was less than a half mile away.

It was positioned onthe Locust Point peninsula which juts into the opening of Baltimore Harbor, andwas constructed in the form of a five-pointed star surrounded by a dry moat — adeep, broad trench. The moat would serve as a shelter from which musketmenmight defend the fort from a land attack. In case of such an attack on thisfirst line of defense, each point, or bastion, was fortified, so that theinvading army would be caught in a crossfire of cannon and musket fire.

The fort is best known as the site upon which the shots initiating the American Civil War were fired, at the Battle of Fort Sumter.<br><br>When the Civil War ended, Fort Sumter was in ruins. The U.S. Army worked to restore it as a useful military installation. The damaged walls were re-leveled to a lower height and partially rebuilt. The third tier of gun emplacements was removed. Eleven of the original first-tier gun rooms were restored with 100-pounder Parrott rifles. During World War I, a small garrison manned the two twelve-inch (305 mm) rifles at Battery Huger. Until World War II, the fort was unused except as a tourist destination; two 90 mm antiaircraft guns were then installed. Fort Sumter became a U.S. National Monument in 1948.

The site preserves the best paleontological record of Tertiary aquatic communities in North America and possibly the world, within the 50-million-year-old Green River lake beds. Fossils preserved, including fish, alligators, bats, turtles, dog-sized horses, insects, and many other species of plants and animals suggest that the region was a low, subtropical, freshwater basin when the sediments accumulated, over about a 2 million-year period.<br><br>Coal mining for the railroad led to the settlement of the nearby town of Fossil, Wyoming, now a ghost town. When the fossils were discovered, miners dug them up to sell to collectors. In particular, Lee Craig sold fossils from 1897 to 1937. Commercial fossil collecting is not allowed within the National Monument, but numerous quarries on private land nearby continue to produce extraordinary fossil specimens, both for museums and for private collectors.

The park consists primarily of portions ofthe Brooks Range of mountains. It was first protected as a U.S. NationalMonument on December 1, 1978, before becoming a national park and preserve twoyears later in 1980 upon passage of the Alaska National Interest LandsConservation Act. A large part of the park is preserved as a wilderness area;some 11,321 mi² (29,322 km²) of wilderness which with the adjoining NoatakWilderness Area forms the largest contiguous wilderness in the United States.<br><br>Thepark's name dates to 1929, when wilderness activist Bob Marshall, exploring theNorth Fork of the Koyukuk River, encountered a pair of mountains (Frigid Cragsand Boreal Mountain), one on each side of the river. He christened this portalthe "Gates of the Arctic."<br><br>Thereare no established roads, trails, visitor facilities, or campgrounds in the park.However, the Dalton Highway (Alaska State Highway 11) comes within five miles(8 km) of the park's eastern boundary. The National Park Service maintains asmall visitor center in nearby Coldfoot on the highway.

The 533-acre (2.16 km2) national monument was established by executive proclamation on November 16, 1907, by President Theodore Roosevelt. It is located in the extreme southern part of Catron County.<br><br>The monument is on a location of 553 acres. The cliff itself was created by volcanic activity. The cliff contains the ruins of interlinked cave dwellings built in five cliff alcoves by the Mogollon peoples. People of the Mogollon culture lived in these cliff dwellings from between 1275 and 1300 AD. Archeologists have identified 46 rooms in the five caves, and believed they were occupied by 10 to 15 families. It is not known why the dwellings were abandoned. The dwellings were a perfect place for human living. The caves provided adequate shelter, while the wooded area concealed the homes. The nearby area also provided for growing and finding food.

Glacier National Park contains two mountain ranges (sub-ranges of the Rocky Mountains), which are sometimes referred to as the southern extension of the Canadian Rockies. The park encompasses over 1 million acres, with 300 lakes (130 of which are definitively named), more than 1,100 different species of vascular plants, 400 species of moss and hundreds of species of animals. Nowhere on the North American continent are the prairies of the Great Plains so proximal to the temperate rain forests of the Pacific Northwest. This vast pristine ecosystem, spread across 1,584 mi² (4,101 km²), is the centerpiece of what has been referred to as the "Crown of the Continent Ecosystem", a region of protected land encompassing 16,000 mi² (44,000 km²). The famed Going-to-the-Sun Road, a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, traverses through the heart of the park and crosses the Continental Divide, allowing visitors breathtaking views of the rugged Lewis and Livingston mountain ranges, as well as dense forests, alpine tundra, waterfalls and two large lakes. Along with the Going-to-the-Sun Road, five historic hotels and chalets are listed as National Historic Landmarks, and a total of 350 locations are on the National Register of Historic Places.<br><br>Glacier National Park borders Waterton Lakes National Park in Canada—the two parks are known as the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, and were designated as the world's first International Peace Park in 1932. Both parks were designated by the United Nations as Biosphere Reserves in 1976, and in 1995 as World Heritage sites. Glacier National Park also shares the northern boundary with the Akamina - Kishenena Provincial Park in British Columbia, Canada.

It was changed to Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve on Dec. 2,1980 by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Glacier BayNational Park and Preserve is a United States National Park in the southeasternpart of Alaska west of Juneau. The park area was included in an InternationalBiosphere Reserve in 1986 and is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The parkcovers 5,130 mi² (13,287 km²). Most of the park is a designated wilderness areawhich covers 4,164 mi² (10,784 km²) of the park.<br><br><br><br>Noroads lead to the park and it is most easily reached by air travel. During somesummers there are ferries to the small community of Gustavus or directly to themarina at Bartlett Cove. Despite the lack of roads, there are over 300,000visitors per year, most on cruise ships.<br><br><br><br>Glaciersdescending from high snow capped mountains into the bay create spectaculardisplays of ice and iceberg formation. In the last century the bay’s mostfamous glacier was probably the Muir Glacier, at one time nearly 3 km (2 miles)wide and about 80 m (265 feet) tall. The Muir Glacier has receded and since the1990s is no longer tidewater. Most visitors today see the Margerie and LamplughGlaciers. All of Glacier Bay was glacier-bound as recently as 1750.

Within the park lies the Grand Canyon, a gorge of the Colorado River, considered to be one of the major natural wonders of the world. The park covers 1,902 mi² (4927 km²) of unincorporated area in Coconino County and Mohave County.<br><br>Most visitors to the park come to the South Rim, arriving on Arizona State Route 64. The Highway enters the park through the South Entrance, near Tusayan, Arizona, and heads eastward, leaving the park through the East Entrance. Some thirty miles of the South Rim are accessible by road. A much smaller venue for tourists is found on the North Rim, accessed by Arizona State Route 67. There is no road connection between the two within Arizona except via the Navajo Bridge, near Page, Arizona, entailing a five-hour drive.<br><br>The area around the Grand Canyon became a national monument on January 11, 1908, and was designated national park on February 26, 1919. The creation of the park was an early success of the environmental conservation movement; its National Park status may have helped thwart proposals to dam the Colorado River within its boundaries. (Lack of this fame may have enabled Glen Canyon Dam to be built upriver, flooding Glen Canyon and creating Lake Powell.) UNESCO has declared it as a World Heritage Site.<br><br>The Grand Canyon itself, including its extensive system of tributary canyons, is valued for the combination of large size, depth, and the exposed layering of colorful rocks dating back to Precambrian times. It was created through the incision of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the Colorado Plateau was uplifted and the Colorado River system developed along its present path.

This path is part of the historic trade route ofthe voyageurs between their wintering grounds and their depots to the east.This route, composed of the Pigeon River and other strategic interior waterwaysas well as the Grand Portage and many other important land portages, was ofenormous importance in pre-industrial times, as it provided quick water accessfrom Canada's settled areas and Atlantic ports to the fur rich NorthWest. Some50 miles (80 km) upstream from Lake Superior, this trade route crosses theHeight of Land Portage connecting South Lake on the Pigeon River watershed withNorth Lake of the Rainy River watershed. This portage crosses the NorthernContinental divide and therefore provides passage between the drainage basin ofthe Arctic Ocean and that of the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River to theAtlantic Ocean.

The park is located approximately 290 miles (470 km)north of Las Vegas and protects 77,000 acres (31,000 ha).<br><br>Thepark is notable for its groves of ancient bristlecone pines, the oldest knownnon-clonal organisms; and for the Lehman Caves at the base of 13,063 ft (3,982m) Wheeler Peak. The caves were originally protected on January 24, 1922, asthe Lehman Caves National Monument, which was later incorporated into the muchlarger national park. There are a number of developed campsites within thepark, as well as excellent back country camping opportunities. Adjacent toGreat Basin National Park lies the Highland Ridge Wilderness. These twoprotected areas provide contiguous wildlife habitat and contiguous protectionto 227.8 square miles (590.0 km2) of eastern Nevada's basin lands.

The park contains approximately 85,000acres (340 km², 130 mi²).<br><br>Thepark contains the tallest sand dunes in North America,[citation needed] risingabout 750 feet (230 m) from the floor of the San Luis Valley on the westernbase of the Sangre de Cristo Range, covering about 19,000 acres (77 km²). Theyare perhaps 12,000 years old.<br><br>Thedunes were formed from sand deposits of the Rio Grande and its tributaries,flowing through the San Luis Valley. Over the ages, westerly winds picked upsand particles from the river flood plain. As the wind lost power beforecrossing the Sangre de Cristo Range, the sand was deposited on the east edge ofthe valley. This process continues, and the dunes are slowly growing. The windchanges the shape of the dunes daily. (SourceWikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sand_Dunes_National_Park_and_Preserve))<br><br>http://www.nps.gov/grsa]]></description>

The fossil horses forwhich the Monument is famous have been found in only one locale in the northernportion of the Monument called the Hagerman Horse Quarry. The 4,351-acre (17.6km²) Monument is internationally significant because it protects the world'srichest known fossil deposits from a time period called the late Plioceneepoch, 3.5 million years ago. These plants and animals represent the lastglimpse of that time that existed before the Ice Age, and the earliestappearances of modern flora and fauna. This is also significant because thefossils present during this period of the Pliocene represent species which werealive during the early stages in the evolution of man, albeit on a differentcontinent.

The term Hopewell (taken from an early farmer whoowned the land where one of the mound complexes was located) culture is appliedto a broad network of beliefs and practices among different Native Americanpeoples who inhabited a large portion of eastern North America. The culture ischaracterized by its construction of enclosures made of earthen walls, oftenbuilt in geometric patterns, and mounds of various shapes. Visible remnants ofHopewell culture are concentrated in the Scioto River valley near present-dayChillicothe, Ohio.<br><br><br><br>Themost striking Hopewell sites contain earthworks in the form of squares,circles, and other geometric shapes. Many of these sites were built to amonumental scale, with earthen walls up to 12 feet (3.7 m) high outlininggeometric figures more than 1,000 feet (300 m) across. Conical and loaf-shapedearthen mounds up to 30 feet (9.1 m) high are often found in association withthe geometric earthworks. The people who built them had a detailed knowledge ofthe local soils, and they combined different types to provide the moststability to the works. It required the organized labor of thousands ofmanhours, as people carried the earth in handwoven baskets.

The western end of the trail is atInterstate State Park. The eastern end is at Potawatomi State Park in DoorCounty. According to Henry S. Reuss's book, the first person to backpack theentire length of the Ice Age Trail was 20 year old James J. Staudacher ofShorewood, Wisconsin during the summer of 1979.

IsleRoyale, the largest island in Lake Superior, is over 45 miles (72 km) in lengthand 9 miles (14 km) wide at its widest point. The park is made of Isle Royaleitself and approximately 400 smaller islands, along with any submerged landswithin 4.5 miles (7.24 km) of the surrounding islands. Isle Royale NationalPark was established on April 3, 1940, was designated as a Wilderness Area in1976, and was made an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980. It is arelatively small national park at 894 square miles (2,314 km²), with only 209square miles (542 km²) above water. At the U.S.-Canada border, it will meet theborders of the future Canadian Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area.<br><br><br><br>Withinthe waters of Isle Royale National Park are several shipwrecks. The area’snotoriously harsh weather, the island’s central location on historic shippingroutes, and the cold, fresh water have culminated in largely intact, wellpreserved wrecks throughout the park. These were documented in the 1980’s, withfollow up occurring in 2009, by the National Park Service Submerged ResourcesCenter.<br><br><br><br>IsleRoyale is not popular with day-trippers because of the scheduling constraintsof transportation to and from the park. The ferries that make this voyage havea relatively long transit time, and thus spend only short periods on theisland. Some ferries may delay—and in some situations cancel—trips during heavyweather.

President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Jewel Cave aNational Monument on February 7, 1908.

The main site is on the edgeof town, in the shadow of State Route 4, also known as the "John MuirParkway". The mansion was built in 1883 by Dr. John Strentzel, Muir'sfather-in-law, with whom Muir went into partnership, managing his 2,600-acre(1,100 ha) fruit ranch.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Muir (and his wife) moved into the house in 1890, and he livedthere until his death in 1914. While living here, Muir realized many of hisgreatest accomplishments, co-founding and serving as the first president theSierra Club in the wake of his battle to prevent Yosemite National Park's HetchHetchy Valley from being dammed, playing a prominent role in the creation ofseveral national parks, writing hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles andseveral books expounding on the virtues of conservation and the natural world,and laying the foundations for the creation of the National Park Service in1916.

The ʻAiʻopio Fishtrap is a 1.7-acre(0.69 ha) pond, with a stone wall forming an artificial enclosure along thenaturally curved shoreline of a bay. Small openings allowed young fish to enterfrom the sea, but as they grew larger (or at low tide) they were easily caughtwith nets inside the trap as needed.

When the flowers Shaw brought thrived in theenvironment, Shaw brought in more plants and started a commercial attractionunder the name W.B. Shaw Lily Ponds in 1912. In 1921, when Shaw died, hisdaughter, Helen Shaw Fowler, took over the prospering business which was beingvisited by many dignitaries, including US presidents. Unfortunately, by thistime the nearby Anacostia River had become filled with an excess of silt makingnavigation on the river difficult. The United States Army Corps of Engineerswas called in to dredge the river which meant that the gardens were in dangerof being destroyed. Helen fought to save the gardens and eventually in 1938,Congress authorized the purchase of the gardens for $15,000 to create the park.(Source Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenilworth_Park_and_Aquatic_Gardens))<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>http://www.nps.gov/keaq]]></description>

Occurring here in relatively pureform, the red metal could be broken out of the rock and worked to make a widevariety of products, from jewelry and tools by its earliest miners to coins andelectric wire by its final generations. Keweenaw copper was mined for approximately7,000 years, from 5000 BCE until 1968. During the period for which records werekept, 1840-1968, more than 11 billion pounds (5 million metric tons) of copperwere mined here. During the peak production years of World War I, 1916-1917,the annual copper yield reached a maximum of 270 million pounds (125,000 t).

Many were once large enough to house up to 20 families, a few horses,and dogs. The dwellings were constructed at ground level. As the dwellings wereabandoned the walls and roof collapsed and created the visible outer circularrim.

Created by an act of Congress in 1992, the nearly 14,000acre (57 km²) preserve protects what is sometimes said to be the nation'slongest mountaintop river, the Little River. The Canyon was historically called"May's Gulf," "gulf" being a common term throughout theCumberland Plateau for this sort of feature (e.g. Savage Gulf in Tennessee, orTrenton Gulf nearby in Georgia, now renamed "Cloudland Canyon").Prior to being assigned to the National Park Service, the Canyon area formedthe southmost unit of Alabama's DeSoto State Park.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The Little River flows for almost its entire length down themiddle of Lookout Mountain in northeast Alabama. Over eons of geologic time,Little River has carved out one of the Southeast's deepest canyons as it windsits way from headwaters in Georgia before exiting the mountain and emptyinginto the Coosa River (Weiss Lake impoundment) near Leesburg, Alabama. Legendhas it that a minor Civil War skirmish occurred on the rim.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The river is said to be among the cleanest and wildestwaterways in the South, undammed aside from a small and derelict hydroelectricproject at DeSoto Falls on the West Fork near Mentone, Alabama. Sandstonecliffs tower up to 600 feet (200 m) above the narrow canyon floor, providing arock climber's paradise and eye-popping vistas from overlooks along the 23 mile(37 km) scenic drive known as Little River Canyon Rim Parkway.

For almost fifty years, it was the home of notedAmerican poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. For a time, it had previously servedas the headquarters of George Washington.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Originally built in 1759, the home's first owner was JohnVassall. He fled the Cambridge area at the beginning of the AmericanRevolutionary War because of his loyalty to the king of England. GeorgeWashington used the abandoned home as his first official headquarters ascommander of the Continental Army; the home served as his base of operationsduring the Siege of Boston until he moved out in July 1776. Andrew Craigie,Washington's Apothecary General, was the next person to own the home for asignificant period of time. After purchasing the house in 1791, he instigatedthe home's only major addition. Craigie's financial situation at the time ofhis death in 1819 forced his widow Elizabeth Craigie to take in boarders. Itwas as a boarder that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow came into the home.

Originally built by businessmanRobert "Fish" Jones, it currently serves as an information center forthe Minneapolis Park System and is on the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway. Severalother replicas of Longfellow's home appear throughout the United States.

The park occupies 81.4square miles (211 km2) (211 square kilometers) near the Four Corners andfeatures numerous ruins of homes and villages built by the ancient Pueblopeople known as the Anasazi. The Anasazi made this stone village their home inthe 1200s AD. It is best known for several spectacular cliff dwellings —structures built within caves and under outcroppings in cliffs — includingCliff Palace, which is thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in NorthAmerica. The Spanish term Mesa Verde translates into English as "greentableland".<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Althoughexplorers from Spain went through the general region in the 18th century,actual sight of the cliffs dwellings by outsiders seems to have first occurredin the latter half of the 19th century. The fame of Mesa Verde soon began tospread thanks to the Wetherill ranchers and the archeological work of GustafNordenskiöld. Vandalism led to the President Teddy Roosevelt's support ofprotecting the area as a national park in 1906. As concern grew over thearchaeological well being of Mesa Verde's ruins, and those in other nearbysites, the area was established as a national park on June 29, 1906.

The battle, labeled "The Battle That SavedWashington," was one of the last the Confederates would carry out in Unionterritory. The two opposing leaders were General Jubal Early, fighting for theSouth, and General Lew Wallace, fighting for the North.<br><br><br><br>Inthe decades following the battle, a few veterans organizations placedcommemorative markers to specific units on the battlefield, including the 14thNew Jersey (dedicated in 1907), 87th Pennsylvania Infantry, and Vermontmarkers. In the years that have followed, other monuments have been added,including the Confederate Monument and Maryland Centennial Monument near theBest farm (the site where Union soldiers discovered Robert E. Lee's lostSpecial Order 191 during the 1862 Maryland Campaign). The National Park Servicehas since added wayside interpretive markers throughout the park.<br><br><br><br>Thevisitor center has been relocated from the historic Gambrill Mill to a newfacility on the west side of the Monocacy River. It offers an electric maporientation program, an interactive computer program, interpretive displays,and artifacts of the battle. The visitor center is the starting point for aself-guided four-mile (6 km) auto tour and 1/2 mile (800 m) loop walking trail.National Park Service rangers and volunteers host battle walks, specialprograms, an auto tour and special events throughout the summer season.

Today the Mormon Trail is a part of the United States National TrailsSystem, as the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail.<br><br>TheMormon Trail extends from Nauvoo, Illinois, which was the principal settlementof the Latter Day Saints from 1839 to 1846, to Salt Lake City, Utah, which wassettled by Brigham Young and his followers beginning in 1847. From CouncilBluffs, Iowa to Fort Bridger in Wyoming, the trail follows much the same routeas the Oregon Trail and the California Trail; these trails are collectivelyknown as the Emigrant Trail.<br><br>Thetrail was used for more than 20 years, until the completion of the FirstTranscontinental Railroad in 1869. Among the emigrants were the Mormon handcartpioneers of 1856–1860. Two of the handcart companies, led by James G. Willieand Edward Martin, met disaster on the trail when they departed late and werecaught by heavy snowstorms in Wyoming.

It protects 559acres (226 ha), of which 240 acres (97 ha) are old growth Coast Redwood (Sequoiasempervirens) forests, one of a few such stands remaining in the San FranciscoBay Area.<br><br><br><br>TheMonument is an old-growth coastal redwood forest. Due to its proximity to thePacific Ocean, the forest is regularly shrouded in coastal fogs, contributingto a wet environment that encourages vigorous plant growth. The fog is alsovital for the growth of the redwoods as they use moisture from the fog duringthe dry summer.<br><br><br><br>Onehundred fifty million years ago ancestors of redwood and sequoia trees grewthroughout the United States. Today, the Sequoia sempervirens can be found onlyin a narrow, cool coastal belt from Monterey to Oregon. Before the loggingindustry came to California, there were an estimated 2 million acres (8,000km²) of old growth forest containing redwoods growing in a narrow strip alongthe coast. By the early 20th century, most of these forests had been cut down.Just north of the San Francisco Bay, one valley named Sequoia Canyon remaineduncut, mainly due to its relative inaccessibility.

The southernend of the route is in Natchez, Mississippi, at an intersection with LibertyRoad; the northern end is northeast of Fairview, Tennessee, in the suburbancommunity of Pasquo, Tennessee, at an intersection with Tennessee 100. The roadlinks the cities of Natchez, Mississippi, and Nashville, Tennessee, via Jacksonand Tupelo, Mississippi, and Florence in northwestern Alabama.<br><br>Thegentle sloping and curving alignment of the route is due to the fact that itfollows an ancient salt-lick-to-grazing pasture migratory route of the AmericanBison and other game, who moved between grazing the pastures of central andwestern Mississippi and the salt and other mineral surface deposits of theCumberland Plateau. The route generally traverses upon the tops of the lowhills and ridges of the watershed divides from northeast to southwest.<br><br>NativeAmericans, following the "traces" of Bison and other game, furtherimproved this "walking trail" for foot-borne commerce between majorvillages located in middle Mississippi and central Tennessee. The route islocally circuitous. However, by traversing this route the Bison, and laterhumans, avoided the endless, energy-taxing climbing and descending of the manyhills along the way. Also avoided was the danger to a herd (or groups of humantravelers) of being caught en-masse at the bottom of a hollow or valley ifattacked by predators. The nature of the route, to this day, affords goodall-around visibility for those who travel it.
