Originally inhabited by the Wabanakipeople, the area includes mountains, an ocean shoreline, woodlands, and lakes.In addition to Mount Desert Island, the park comprises much of the Isle auHaut, a small island to the southwest of Mount Desert Island and parts of BakerIsland, also nearby. A portion of Schoodic Peninsula on the mainland is alsopart of the park. In total, Acadia National Park consists of 30,300 acres (47square miles or 123 km2) on Mount Desert Island, 2,728 acres (4.6 square milesor 11 km2) on Isle au Haut and 2,366 acres (3.5 square miles or 9.2 km2) on theSchoodic Peninsula.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thelandscape architect Charles Elliot is credited with the idea for the park. Itfirst attained federal status when President Woodrow Wilson, established it asSieur de Monts National Monument on July 8, 1916, administered by the NationalPark Service. On February 26, 1919, it became a national park, with the nameLafayette National Park in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette, an influentialFrench supporter of the American Revolution. The park's name was changed toAcadia National Park on January 19, 1929. From 1915 to 1933, the wealthy philanthropistJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr. financed, designed, and directed the construction of anetwork of carriage trails throughout the park. The network encompassed over 50miles (80 km) of gravel carriage trails, 17 granite bridges, and two gatelodges, almost all of which are still maintained and in use today. Cut granitestones placed along the edges of the carriage roads act as guard rails of sortand are locally known as "coping stones" to help visitors cope withthe steep edges. They are also fondly called "Rockefeller's teeth".

In addition to "Peacefield," home to four generations of the Adams family, the park's main historic features include: John Adams birthplace (October 30, 1735), the nearby John Quincy Adams birthplace (July 11, 1767); the Stone Library (built in 1870 to house the books of John Quincy Adams and believed to be the first presidential library) containing more than 14,000 historic volumes.<br><br>There is an off-site visitor center less than a mile (1.6 km) away. Regularly scheduled tours of the houses are offered in season (April 19 to November 10), by guided tour only, using a tourist trolley provided by the Park Service between sites.

The main feature of the Monument is a valley of the Niobrara River, and the fossils found on Carnegie Hill and University Hill. The area largely consists of grass-covered plains. Plants on the site include prairie sandreed, blue grama, little bluestem and needle and thread grass, and the wildflowers lupin, spiderwort, western wallflower and sunflowers. The site is best known for the large number of well-preserved Miocene fossils, many of which were found at dig sites on Carnegie and University Hills. Fossils from the site, which date from about 20 million years ago, are among some of the best specimens of Miocene mammals. <br><br>Originally the Agate Springs Ranch, a working cattle ranch, was owned by Capt. James Cook. The monument's museum collection also contains more than 500 artifacts from the Cook Collection of Plains Indian artifacts. The national monument was authorized on June 5, 1965, but was not established until June 14, 1997.

The site has been designated a National Historic Landmark and National Monument.<br><br>On February 27, 2006, President George W. Bush signed a proclamation designating the federal land as the 123rd National Monument. It was the 390th unit of the National Park System.

It has a catchment area of approximately 1400 square mi (3600 km²). It is located in central Lake and Peninsula Borough. In Yupik, the word "Alagnak" means "to err." Every year, the river changes its course and branches anew, for which reason it is sometimes called the "Branch River."<br><br>Due to the large numbers of salmon, there is a significant bear population in the summer and fall, including both grizzly and black bears. The majority of the catchment area is a winter habitat for Alaskan caribou. Moose are also to be found during the entire year. Along the river, beaver, foxes, wolverines, mink, and otter are all found as well occasional wolf. In the water, there are several varieties of salmon, including sockeye salmon, pink salmon, chum salmon, king salmon, and silver salmon. There are also rainbow trout, char, arctic grayling, and northern pike. Along the river there is also eclectic vegetation including spruces, willows and various types of berries.<br><br>The upper 67 mi (108 km) of the river is designated as a protected "wild and scenic river" in accordance with ANILCA, the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act. This part of the river is known as the Alagnak Wild River. (Source Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alagnak_Wild_River))<br><br>http://www.nps.gov/alag]]></description>

It offers visitors a glimpse of both natural and cultural history, and traces the historic footprints of the U.S. Army Base, Fort Schwatka, located at the Ulakta Head on Mount Ballyhoo. The fort, 800 miles west of Anchorage, the nearest large urban center, was one of four coastal defense posts built to protect Dutch Harbor (crucial back door to the United States) during World War II; Fort Schwatka is also the highest coastal battery ever constructed in the United States. Engineers designed the concrete observation posts and command stations to withstand earthquakes and 100 mph winds. Although today, many of the bunkers and wooden structures of Fort Schwatka have collapsed, the gun mounts and lookouts are among the most intact in the country.<br><br>In 1996, the United State Congress designated this a National Historic Area as a way of educating future generations both about the history of the Aleut people, and the role the Aleutian Islands played in the defense of the United States in World War II.

It was a series of 10 inclines, approximately 36 miles (58 km) long, and operated from 1834 to 1854. It connected two canal divisions of the Main Line of Public Works of the Pennsylvania Canal from Johnstown on the west to Hollidaysburg on the east, thus allowing continuous barge traffic between the Ohio and the Susquehanna rivers. Considered a technological marvel in its day, it played a critical role in opening the interior of the United States beyond the Appalachian Mountains to settlement and commerce. It included the first railroad tunnel in the United States, the Staple Bend Tunnel, and its inauguration was marked with great fanfare.<br><br>Today, the remains of the railroad are preserved within the Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site operated by the National Park Service. The site was established on 1,296 acres (524 ha) in 1964 and is about 12 miles (19.3 km) west of Altoona,[citation needed] in Blair and Cambria counties.

"Amistad" is Spanish for "friendship", as the Amistad Reservoir is located on the border with Mexico. The reservoir was created by Amistad Dam in 1969.<br><br>The lake provides year-round, water-based recreation opportunities, including boating, fishing, swimming, scuba diving and water-skiing, as well as other recreational opportunities for picnicking, camping and hunting. The area is rich in archeology and rock art, and contains a wide variety of plant and animal life. For highly experienced scuba divers, there is a system of deep underwater caves that can be accessed. The dive includes exotic gas mixes, pre-placement of gas cylinders, and extensive decompression times at depth. These caves are considered extremely hazardous and should not be attempted by anyone without extensive training and preparation.<br><br>The site was administered under a cooperative agreement with the International Boundary and Water Commission as Amistad Recreation Area, November 11, 1965. It was authorized as a National Recreation Area on November 28, 1990.

The park preserves Biscayne Bay, one of the top scuba diving areas in the United States. Ninety-five percent of the park is water. In addition, the shore of the bay is the location of an extensive mangrove forest. The park covers 207 mi² (700 km²).<br><br>Elliott Key, the park's largest island, is considered the first of the true Florida Keys being formed from fossilized coral reef, i.e. Key Largo limestone. The islands farther north in the park are transitional islands of coral and sand.<br><br>The major attraction of the park is scuba diving or snorkeling on the coral reef inside the bay. It is also possible to take a glass-bottom boat tour of the bay, or rent kayaks to explore the bay and the islands (Florida Keys) in it. While accessing the historic homes of Stiltsville is currently not allowed by casual visitors, these structures may still be observed from boats.
